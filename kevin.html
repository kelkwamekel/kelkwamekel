    AGYEI KELVIN KWAME is my name a first year biomedical engineering student at KNUST.From a young age, i have been fascinated by the study of science and technology as well and this is the reason why i decided to read biomedical engineering
    My passion for reading biomedical engineering is to be able to invert new medical devices and also make the work of medical practitioners easy by making technolgy meet medicine.
    I aspire to work on a smart telescope and a device for determining the blood pressures in the human body. 
    These are some of the many reasons why i decided to read biomedical engineering. THANK YOU.
